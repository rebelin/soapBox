# "SOAPBOX" World Effect
Not a soap, but a foam of expression. Craft a bespoke platform from your own photos/videos, then take the stand to defend it (free podium included).

## GTHackathon 2020 Facebook Sponser Challenge
For this challenge, we were tasked with creating an innovative World AR effect for Instagram Reels using Spark AR Studio, specifically the plane tracking and segmentation features.

Our team wanted to create an open platform available to raise their voice and spread their message to the world. The concept of the soapbox, a platform often used by the common person to rally his fellows for justice and change, was the main creative driving force behind our development of the "SOAPBOX" Instagram world effect. With our platform, anyone can record their message to the world from behind a podium, the modern-day soapbox, along with a dynamic graphic to support their voice.
